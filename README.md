### Automatic code formatting

[Prettier][] aims to provide codebase consistency when multiple developers work on the same project. The main reason behind adopting it is to [stop all the on-going debates over coding styles][].

### Static type checking

[TypeScript][] adds optional types to JavaScript, preventing several programming mistakes. For a quick guide about using React with it, please refer to the [React TypeScript Cheatsheet][].
